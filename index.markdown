Hi!

My name is Akhil Ganesan. I'm an aspiring biomedical engineer (with an interest in computer science and advanced technologies) hoping to specialize in fields such as cellular/tissue/genetic engineering, neuroengineering, immunoengineering, & computational biology. Currently, my relevant experiences have independently involved engineering/technology (see my [past projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.markdown %}) and my [GitHub](https://github.com/akhil-ganesan)) or biosciences; however, entering the Georgia Institute of Technology to study Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science (concentrating in artificial intelligence) marks the beginning of my journey in advancing the technological revolution of medicine for the greater good.

If you'd like to connect or would like a copy of my resume, I can be reached by email ([akhilganesan526@gmail.com](mailto:akhilganesan526@gmail.com)) or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akhil-ganesan). Feel free to browse this site, which includes my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link cv.markdown %}), [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.markdown %}), & [School Course Notes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link classnotes.markdown %}).
