Hi!

My name is Akhil Ganesan. I'm an aspiring biomedical engineer (with an interest in computer science and advanced technologies) hoping to specialize in fields such as cellular/tissue/genetic engineering, neuroengineering, immunoengineering, & computational biology. Currently, my relevant experiences have independently involved engineering/technology (see my [past projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.markdown %}) and my [GitHub](https://github.com/akhil-ganesan)) or biosciences; however, entering the Georgia Institute of Technology to study Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science (concentrating in artificial intelligence) marks the beginning of my journey in advancing the technological revolution of medicine for the greater good.
