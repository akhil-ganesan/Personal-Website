Here are a couple takeaways after my Fall 2023 at Georgia Tech:

## Curricular

I ended this semester with a 4.0 GPA taking the following 7 classes (18 credits):
- **Intro to Biomedical Engineering** (BMED 1000, 1 credit): This class taught biomedical engineering principles in a project-oriented environment (see my final project design report under [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.markdown %})) & gave students a new perspective on the field of biomedical engineering in a conversational environment. The class was fairly light, but informative/practical for future classes/applications.  
- **Foundations of Health** (APPH 1040, 2 credits): This class is a general institute requirement and taught students fundamentals to living healthy, with projects/assignments that reinforced those principles. Not much else to say here.
- **Statics** (COE 2001, 2 credits): This class expands on Intro Physics I (Mechanics) by looking at static systems such as trusses, frames, machines, distributed force/masses (with bending/shear moment diagrams), & fluids. This class was tougher but practical, with future applications in biomechanics (covering dynamics/deformable bodies) & biotransport/biosolid & biofluid mechanics.
- **Principles & Applications of Engineering Materials** (MSE 2001, 3 credits): This class bridged concepts from general chemistry and physics to characterize material properties, structure, & processing (essentially, "General Chemistry II for Engineers"). It covered a wide breadth of practical content for possible applications in biomaterials and material selection for medical device/robotics design. 
- **Survey of Organic Chemistry** (CHEM 1315, 3 credits): This class covered essential content across 2 semesters of organic chemistry for engineering applications. I'd say though this class isn't comprehensive for the concepts and I'd highly suggest anyone interested in medicine or biomolecular engineering to do a chemistry minor & take the 2-course/1-lab traditional organic chemistry sequence or self-study the remaining organic chemistry content from the skipped sections in the course textbooks.  
- **Intro to Object-Oriented Programming** (CS 1331, 3 credits): This class was essentially a comprehensive view of the Java programming language & how it demonstrates object-oriented principles. I self-studied and tested out of this class at the beginning of the semester for my CS Minor requirements; I've heard this class's knowledge/conventions are also not followed in future CS classes making it a weed out/bridge class for CS majors.  
- **Introductory Physics II** (PHYS 2212, 4 credits): This class is a standard general institute engineering requirement. However, at Georgia Tech the content was taught in a unique sequence, ending by comprehensively teaching Maxwell's Equations and expanding to special topics such as electrodynamics, optics, and radiation.

Next semester I plan to take the following classes: Differential Equations, Statistics for Bioengineering, Circuits & Electronics, Conservation Principles in BME, & either Biomechanics, Data Structures & Algorithms, or Computer Organization.

## Extracurricular

With respect to clubs, this semester I joined Bioinformatics Club & Healthcare Innovations Club (I may continue next semester pursuing a healthcare AI-related project for them). I also may join the Medical Robotics Club & Biotechnology Club next semester if time permits. 

This semester, I wasn't able to begin doing BME research. This has translated to my primary goal for next semester. Instead, this semester I spent time working on [personal projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.markdown %}) (to which I advanced my CS technical skills), revising my resume, networking, & applying to opportunities/internships. This is something I'll continue next semester through spring recruiting season.

Overall, I plan to put more emphasis on my extracurricular activities as I settle into my coursework routines that I've accustomed to from first semester.

## Future Career Plans

This semester has given me a chance to reflect on "Why Biomedical Engineering" and what I plan to do with the degree. After exploring, I believe my interests lie in biocomputing, specifically in field such as AI engineering for healthcare applications, machine learning for biomolecular engineering/drug design, analysis of genomic data for characterizing phenotypical outcomes, etc. This is also the reason I chose to add a CS Minor (Concentrating in artificial intelligence). I'm also intrigued by emerging fields such as immuno/neuroengineering as technology becomes increasingly integrated in their work. I hope to explore this more through research, clubs, & projects.
