## Georgia Tech Biomedical Engineering Degree Visualizer

This web app was developed to help biomedical engineering students at Georgia Tech plan their class schedules based on course prerequisites to fulfill their degree requirements. It uses a Flask framework (with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript) for the front-end and on the back-end uses Python (which models the prerequisite chain as a graph to determine course recommendations).

## Detecting & Extracting Information from Genetically-Mutated Data Using AI

This study explores generalized datasets which have defects analogous to genetic mutations (specifically, frameshift & substitution mutations) by attempting to use neural networks to predict whether frameshift mutations have occurred (which it could with around 95% accuracy) and prior to the frameshift, the probability of substitution mutations occuring (which it could with around 80% accuracy). The decrease in frameshift detection/information extraction accuracy per the decrease in data volume was also analyzed empirically.

## An Analysis of Learning Loss in a Post-COVID World

This project provided an in-depth analysis of the emerging impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on education in both a national & regional (state of Virginia) context. This analysis utilized the ArcGIS tools suite as well as a simple feed-forward neural network written in python. The results include specific demographic factors that may have an impact on the level of learning loss (although, the analysis found there was little direct correlation with each variable individually). It also includes a summary of the impact of learning loss and what steps can be taken to remedy it on the state level. This project earned an Honorable Mention for James Madison University's annual spring Geospatial Analysis competition.

## An Application of Machine Learning for Economic Trend Prediction

In this paper we present the results of a quantitative finance experiment testing a variety of machine learning architectures (statistical analysis, support vector regression, & a neural network) in their ability to predict economic trends. The economic trends explored were a technical analysis of stock prices in the market (in particular, the Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), & Netflix (NFLX) share prices over a 5 year period). This project won 1st Place at the Fairfax Regional Science & Engineering Fair (Intelligent Machines Category) and Qualified for the Virginia State Science & Engineering Fair.

## Intro to Biomedical Engineering Final Project: Design Report

This report details a semester-long group project analyzing and redesigning a disposable medical device: specifically, the clear wound dressing. The report includes research comrpising the device's characteristics/life cycle, stakeholders invovled in it's use, and current design shortcomings. The report also includes products from ideation & prototyping of possible solutions to the group's defined problem of interest.

## Statics Final Project: Structural Analysis

This project report details a semester-long group project analyzing the structural stability of the Kendeda Building at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Specifically, the stilt architecture was quantitatively analyzed using statics concepts (i.e, frames, distributed masses, etc.).
