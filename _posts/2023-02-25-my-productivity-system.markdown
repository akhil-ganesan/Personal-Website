To stay productive as a student involved in various commitments since high school, I use the following system to track my events and tasks for time management. While I do believe everyone should have a system for this to maximize their time management and work capabilities, I believe that system will be unique per person. Hopefully my system could spark some inspiration to those looking to create or improve their own.

## Tasks v.s. Events
To start, I like to distinguish my commitments as either tasks or events. Events typically have a time block associated with them, while tasks just have to be done by a deadline (either preset or something I arbitrarily set). To reiterate this point, the following are examples of each:
- Attending/taking an exam for a class is an event; completing the class's homework is a task
- Attending a club/research meeting is an event; completing my deliverables for each meet is a task
- Attending career fairs/networking events is an event; preparing my resume/elevator pitch & applying to companies is a task

Now using this distinction, I have a different system to keep track of events and tasks. Although this may seem arduous and repetitive because in the above examples the tasks and events go hand in hand, some events don't have associated tasks (i.e. clubs/classes where I don't have work to prepare beforehand) and some tasks don't have associated events (i.e. writing articles like these and other personal projects) breaking down this link.

Additionally, two other terms I'll reference are mandatory and discretionary time (& management). To understand these, I'll draw a parallel to the U.S. government's economic spending: mandatory is typically required spending for social programs while discretionary is flexible spending for policies. Analogously, mandatory time goes to required commitments typically (i.e. classes, major club/research meetings, etc.) that are saved as events. In contrast, discretionary time refers to the remaining time outside mandatory; this typically goes to my personal/living time along with time to complete my work (which, if without a time block, are usually saved as events). Restated, events are what I have to do & tasks are what I could do when I don't have anything to do.

## Events
To keep track of events I use my phone's calendar, which is fairly standard across most apps. As a college student, I have repetitive events for all my classes (with timely phone reminders to ensure I have time to walk to their locations). Additionally, I add extra logistical information to each event (i.e. the event location/room number or virtual meeting link) which allows me quicker access than having to open my email and search for such information immediately prior to the event.

Finally, one other personal adjustment I use for my calendar system is the color-coding of events. I typically have my classes in purple, exams/quizzes/assessments in yellow, extracurricular events in light green, college logistic-related events in salmon, and other major research event dates in orange (along with the standard holiday calendar in dark green and my personal event calendar in aqua & dark blue). This simple system allows me to look at my calendar and within a fraction of a second know exactly how my day, week, and month are going with regards to the color variation. The yellow allows me to pinpoint my high-midterm weeks and the green reminds me when I have commitments post-classes. This allows me a quick, accessible, and maintainable way to stay on top of my mandatory time management.

## Tasks
To stay on top of my tasks, I use my notes app and have a "living" checklist of my commitments. Additionally, I'll rank items by priority of completion (typically based on factors like due dates if they exist, estimated work to complete, whether the task is linked to future tasks, etc.) This system allows me to quickly look at my task list and, based on the prioritization, start working efficiently to complete the work on my plate (rather than wasting time figuring out what work to complete). I'll typically assign prioritization as items are added and removed from the list, which makes development and management of the list minimal.

Now regarding how I actually develop tasks: typically I'll divide up my tasks into class-related work (which takes the highest priority typically), then extracurricular work, & finally personal tasks (which typically take the lowest priority or are done in parallel with other tasks). Furthermore, each task is written with specificity in mind: i.e. rather than a single task listed as "finish applications", this is divided into multiple (i.e. finish apps for REUs, internships saved on LinkedIn, project teams, Georgia Tech clubs, etc.) In this manner, it's easier to prioritize the subtasks of this major task, and checking off subtasks in prioritized order gives more of a sense of accomplishment accompanied with increased work efficiency/direction. Ultimately, by maintaining this "living" task list, I can efficiently manage my work during my discretionary time.

## Evaluation
In analyzing this system, I realized it was developed to target 2 problems I had prior to time management: forgetting/being late to events and wasting time being indecisive on what to work on during my work time. The first I was able to combat by using the event system to apportion my mandatory time. The second I was able to combat by developing the task system to prioritize and order my work during discretionary time (which also allowed me to judge how much discretionary time I have to appropriate for work rather than personal endeavors). The point here is that my system was developed to fill the gaps in my time management needs: if you're in the process of developing/improving your system, look no further than to yourself and your current time management flaws to develop a solution.
