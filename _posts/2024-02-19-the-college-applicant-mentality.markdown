Let's face the honest truth: college applications are one of the most critical points in people’s lives. Depending on the final outcome, they can set people on significantly diverging paths in life. And so, it makes sense that there is so much worry and stress around the matter. But while studies have shown a helpful level of stress is a natural biological response that can help us manage crucial decisions such as this process, I find that far too many people stress over parts of this process that we can’t control, leading to an unhealthy level of stress and deteriorating mental health. So let's take a deeper dive into this.

## What We Can Control

1. The application quality
2. Where & by what application type do we apply to

In your underclassmen years, it's easier to enhance #1 by trying new innovative extracurricular activities, winning prestigious awards/competitions, maintaining high grades, etc. As you get to your senior year, the only thing that can be manipulated under #1 for the better is your application presentation (what activities/awards to include) & your essays.

As for point #2, deciding where and by what method to apply is crucial, but ultimately isn’t more influential to your ultimate results when compared to #1. Plus, most of this is presolved as you develop your college list.

## What We Can’t Control

1. Our results (albeit, while we have some control before submitting our apps, but after there’s virtually nothing we can do but wait)
2. Our background factors (experiences to write about in essays, financial situation as pertaining to cost/aid, etc.)

## What To Focus On

So why did I just list what we can and can’t control? Because you should only worry about what we can control; worrying about that can actually help increase the quality of your apps and better your chances at succeeding in this process. Meanwhile, worrying about what we can’t control changes nothing in the results and only adds an extra unnecessary mental burden. 

So stop stressing after submitting apps and stop stressing before apps about whether a specific school will accept you; worry about whether your application is as well written as possible to properly present yourself. I’ve found this latter situation commonly arises due to the college hierarchy and unwarranted prestige that dream schools or college rankings/classifications (i.e. Ivy League, Neo Ivy, Public Ivy, HYPSM, etc.) give to specific institutions. Because in reality, it’s highly unlikely that any college is perfect for anyone; if you think a specific institution is, you might need to look slightly harder to find its flaws. So instead of idolizing a specific “dream school” and stressing unnecessarily day and night about whether they’ll accept you or whether you’re “good enough”, note the following:

1. Colleges in America are all a business scheme; truly don’t take their results personally because their main objective is to maximize their profits, not find and collect brilliant minds together and provide them with resources to change the world (although they frame it as this, it’s not their main objective)

2. This isn’t Avengers: Endgame. There isn’t only 1 way to be successful which entails going to 1 specific college. In reality, every college on your list will have their own flaws, but they are on your list because you can see yourself succeeding there in the future in multiple ways. So rather than worrying about not getting in or even getting a rejection letter and thinking about the lost opportunities, be hopeful through the process as you look for various institutions to apply to and envision numerous ways you see yourself reaching success in your target field.

Point 2 illustrates what I mean by “The College Applicant Mentality”. The college process should be healthily-stressful in preparing/presenting the apps, but hopeful & exciting when looking for colleges to apply to as you visualize numerous diverging successful futures each institution would offer you. If anything, take that with you and enjoy your senior year because it doesn’t deserve to be wasted woefully worrying on the thoughts of an admissions officer you don’t know.
