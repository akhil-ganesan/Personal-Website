Here are a couple takeaways after my Spring 2023 at Georgia Tech:

## Curricular

I ended this semester with a 4.0 GPA taking the following 5 classes (16 credits):
- **Conservation Principles in Biomedical Engineering** (BMED 2110, 3 credits): This introductory BME class taught students the problem-solving process (i.e. proper diagramming conventions, degree of freedom analysis, developing Fermi estimates, applying the principles of mass & energy conservation, etc.) to approach complex problems with (predominantly in the chemical/systems engineering space).
- **Introduction to Bioengineering Statistics** (BMED 2400, 3 credits): This BME class satisfies the general institute’s statistics requirement for engineers, covering concepts like experimental design, introductory probability/combinatorics, foundations of statistical theory, & specific data analysis tests (i.e. t/z, chi squared, Mann-Whitney U, 1 & 2-way ANOVA, linear/logistic regression, principal component analysis, and more). This class was also centered around a data-analysis project to emphasize real-world application of learning; this project included utilizing concepts from the class (i.e. statistical tests) as well as concepts beyond the class scope (i.e. applying AI/ML algorithms for deeper analysis).
- **Circuits and Electronics** (ECE 3710, 2 credits): This class is a standard general institute engineering requirement. Along with a 1 credit lab sequence class (ECE 3741), it gives non-ECE students a survey of ECE techniques such as DC/AC circuit analysis, electronics design, etc.
- **Differential Equations** (MATH 2552, 4 credits): This class is the final institute math requirement for engineers. However, at Georgia Tech the class moved at a fast pace, covering additional content than typical (including topics like approximations of non-linear ODEs/systems, chaos theory/divergence of numerical estimations, and applications of ODEs/systems in physics & biology).
- **Computer Organization & Programming** (CS 2110, 4 credits): This foundational CS class taught students the essentials to build a computer from scratch. Starting with low-level digital logic and ultimately reaching object-oriented/procedural programming, this class covered concepts ranging from finite state machines, dynamic memory allocation, machine/assembly language, foundations of operating systems, etc. It is part of a 2-class sequence with CS 2200 (Computer Systems & Networks); however, this sequence varies from the analogous ECE sequence as CS 2110 covers all the essential concepts and CS 2200 expands on those concepts; meanwhile the 2 ECE computer architecture classes split the content by abstraction level (i.e. the first class covers the low-level digital logic and programming & the second class covers higher-level concepts like C programming, memory allocation, etc.)

Next semester I plan to take the following classes: Systems Physiology, Electronics & Instrumentation Lab, Problems in Biomedical Engineering, Data Structures & Algorithms, and either a Humanities class or Introduction to Biomechanics.

## Extracurricular

This semester I joined the Medical Robotics Club (where I worked on the Industry team developing a prototype for a head-stabilization device utilizing particle-jamming) & Quizbowl team. I also began research in the Sulchek Lab, where I’m helping develop a vision processing pipeline to track cells moving through a microfluidic device.

Next semester, I hope to increase my time commitment to my clubs/research in lieu of my reduced course load in addition to increasing my efforts to network, develop my resume, and attain an internship.

## Insights from This Semester

This semester I was able to apply myself significantly more than I had last fall. I believe the next couple semesters are critical to maximizing my experience at Georgia Tech, which implies I should get involved in as many enriching opportunities as possible to expand my comfort zone and gain a wider variety of technical experience. This also means placing a greater emphasis on my projects, research, and other meaningful opportunities I already have and can further develop.

This was also the first semester I began taking major and minor-specific classes beyond just general engineering requirements; while initially I expected these classes to all be markedly more difficult relative to their prerequisites, I learned the class’s difficulty, quality, organization, and grading varied significantly with instructor, section, semester (fall/spring), teaching assistants, etc. This non-standardization explains why classes don’t hold significant relevance in applications for jobs, research, etc. as it again means students are in charge of their own learning to a greater degree.
