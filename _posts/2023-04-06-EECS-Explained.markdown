For many interested in entering a career in tech, there are 3 popular programs of study: electrical engineering (EE), computer engineering (CE), & computer science (CS). In addition to this, there are programs that combine these fundamental 3 fields (i.e. computer science & engineering, electrical & computer engineering, and EECS: electrical engineering & computer science). However, these fields are all intertwined and overlapped, causing confusion in which to choose for most. In general, here's how each major breaks down: 
- **Electrical Engineering**: A general survey of the applications of electronics (i.e. circuits, sensors, optical tech, signals, etc.) in fields like robotics, telecommunications, embedded systems, computer technology, etc.
- **Computer Engineering**: A field dedicated to the application of electronics for developing computers, supplementing this hardware content with core computer software concepts (i.e. computer architectures/organizations, core computing software (i.e. operating systems, compilers/interpreters, etc.), and computing networks/security)
- **Computer Science**: A general survey of non-hardware concepts related to computing such as the aforementioned core computing software, general software engineering (i.e. App & Web App development, UX/UI, etc.), theoretical CS (which is an interdisciplinary field spurring from mathematics primary concerned with algorithms/complexity theory, information theory, etc.), and applied computational mathematics (i.e. data science, artificial intelligence & machine learning, etc.)

To further elaborate, the below graphic breaks down each of these fields into their individual and interdisciplinary subjects.

A Map of the EECS Superdiscipline</p>

For clarification, this diagram isn't restrictive: computer engineers can be software engineers (SWE), electrical engineers can enter cybersecurity (in particular with hardware security), etc. What the diagram is meant to represent is what majors are most aligned with a specific subdiscipline, not the versatility of each major. For instance, someone with a primary interest in SWE will benefit uniquely from a CS major compared to other majors; someone with an interest in computing hardware (i.e. emerging tech like quantum computing) would uniquely benefit from a computer/electrical engineering degree when compared to the alternatives; etc. 

Generally, those interested in all electronic hardware should consider EE; those interested in only hardware for computers should consider CE, & those not interested in hardware at all should consider CS (or math if their endeavors are more theoretical/academic focused).
