So, I was looking for content to write about and I found an old spreadsheet where I performed an “power rankings”-esq analysis of Virginia high school science olympiad teams (cringing as I write this, I took this club way too seriously in high school). The analysis looked at the pre- and post-COVID state tournament performance of teams (ranging from 2018 to 2023), marking the canceled 2020 state competition as the temporal boundary. The below image summarizes the high-level results.

Summaring Results of Virginia SciOly Analysis
</p>

**Notes**: 
- As can be seen in the first average column (which averages performance over all 5 years), it's easy to divide the state into 5 primary tiers, where tiers 2-4 are quite contested, but tier 1 and 5 are definitively separate from the others.
- Why is tier 5 distinct? Tier 5 consists of teams that haven’t qualified to every state competition in the last 5 years (i.e. Freedom has only qualified recently, which Champe and Stonebridge have only qualified prior to 2022); the italicized ranks are substituted data (assumed last place) so analyses could be performed
- Notable outliers: Only one team has been in the top 4 that isn’t in tier 1 (2023 Woodson) & 4 teams outside tier 1 have placed 5th (Madison, Woodson, Chantilly, & Centreville; this is evenly split between tier 2 & 3 across pre and post-COVID years)
- According to the last “trend” column (which takes a difference between a team’s average placement pre- and post-COVID), the highest rising-rank teams include Centreville & Blacksburg, with the highest falling-rank teams being Potomac Falls, McLean (although they did place 9th in 2023), & Marshall
- TJHSST, Langley, Madison, & Champe are the only teams to stay the same rank across the COVID seasons, which is particularly impressive with Madison as they’re ranked in the contested tier 2-4 range
