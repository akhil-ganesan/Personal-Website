The CS major is structured at Georgia Tech such that students select 2 concentrations to specialize in, called threads. The CS minor has different requirements and requires the selection of 1 thread. The following is a list of the threads:

- **Intelligence**: Covers topics in AI
- **Information Internetworks**: Covers topics in networks/security, database/distributed systems, etc.
- **People**: Covers topics in social computing and human-centric technology
- **Media**: Covers topics in graphic/media technologies
- **Systems & Architecture**: Covers topics in computer architecture/abstractions, programming languages, platforms, etc.
- **Devices**: Covers topics in embedded systems & programming for devices
- **Modeling & Simulation**: Covers topics in data science/analysis (the minor is broken down into 2 different threads: Computational Data Analysis and Scientific & Engineering Computing)
- **Theory**: Covers topics in algorithms and mathematical foundations of CS

## Thread Combinations for CS Majors
The following are my suggested thread combinations for specializing in various indicated CS subfields:

**Best Combo for Software Engineering**: *Information Internetworks + Systems & Architecture*
> These 2 threads comprehensively cover the systems & network engineering side of computer science, which is heavily drawn upon when developing software ranging from web apps to operating systems. 

**Best Combo for Data Science**: *Intelligence + Modeling & Simulation*
> This thread combination's content comprises a variety of quantitative analysis methods, with an emphasis on using modern machine learning/artificial intelligence techniques for data-driven insights.

**Best Combo for Easiest/Quickest Degree**: *People + Media*
> This thread pair results in the greatest number of free electives in addition to having generally one of the least intensive curricula (relatively to other thread pairs), allowing most to graduate early or add certificates/minors to their degree. 

**Best Combo for Robotics**: *Devices + a Data Science thread (Modeling & Simulation or Intelligence)*
> Although this combination will include content covering the engineering of software for robotic and mechatronic applications, my suggestion for pursuing robotics would be to either add a Robotics minor to the degree or select an engineering-centric primary major (i.e. Mechanical, Electrical, or Computer Engineering) with either a minor in Computer Science (see below) or Robotics.

**Best Combo for CS Research/Algorithm Development/AI or ML Engineering**: *Theory + Intelligence*
> This thread combination is arguably one of the most quantitative, preparing students for a future in the mathematical side of computer science (such as developing new algorithms, a subset of which include AI/ML techniques); an alternative to this would be to select a mathematics major (which will prepare one for research and formal mathematics better) and use the plentiful free/STEM electives on a CS Minor.

**Best Combo for a Comprehensive CS Degree**: *Systems & Architecture + Theory*
> This combination pairs the most comprehensive thread covering the computer/electrical engineering side of CS with that covering the mathematics/data science side of CS respectively. This degree is generally considered one of the toughest if not the toughest combinations, but it also yields the greatest breadth of content covered and skills gained.

**Next Best Combo for a Comprehensive CS Degree**: *Information Internetworks + Intelligence*
> This combination pairs the next best threads from the above 2 categories. This combination may be more ideal for most as it's arguable that Information Internetworks replaces niche content from Systems & Architecture with courses more practical to software engineering (and likewise with the Intelligence and Theory thread, placing more of an emphasis on data science/analysis than pure mathematics which is less practical in industry). Additionally, the courses are considered easier content wise. As a result, this thread combination is one of the most popular at Georgia Tech, with its "better" counterpart practically unseen. 

## Threads for the CS Minor

To evaluate the utility of each CS minor, I looked at the course requirements for each, bearing in mind the following:
* The 3 most useful/fundamental CS courses are Data Structures & Algorithms, Computer Organization & Programming, and Objects & Design (which is a project-based course where students develop an application, which is uniquely useful for non-CS majors looking to add a technical project to their portfolio)
* Other upper-level courses tend to be significantly tougher in difficulty and aren't going to be particularly useful for most non-CS majors, who likely only seek to gain general CS & programming skills from the minor (this principle can be ignored if the student is interested in the upper-level courses or if those courses may have significance to their primary major i.e. a BME major/CS minor concentrating in Intelligence for Biomedical AI)

Based this paradigm, the following rankings evaluate the CS Minor threads:

1. **Media**: The media thread is the only thread that requires all 3 "fundamental" CS courses. Furthermore, compared to other threads, the upper-level requirements tend to be lighter courses than those of other more intensive threads. This makes it the most ideal thread for a generalized CS minor.
2. **Intelligence**: The intelligence thread requires 2 "fundamental" CS courses (missing Objects & Design, which isn't a significant loss if the student already has technical projects to showcase). Furthermore, the upper-level courses covering topics in AI & ML are very likely to complement another primary major.
3. **People**: This thread includes 2 "fundamental" courses (excluding Computer Organization & Programming). Ultimately these 2 courses set up students for having the skills to enter software development/engineering for application development, but the lack of Computer Organization & Programming prevents entering systems software development and working on low-level programming projects without extracurricular skill development. Despite this, the people thread electives are typically considered relatively easy compared to the other threads (although, they may not serve as practical).   
4. **Systems & Architecture/Information Internetworks/Devices**: These 3 threads require very similar course requirements, which induce their common grouping. They all require 2 common courses (Computer Organization & Programming and a class that builds on it: Computer Systems & Networks) and cover this systems-sector of computer science comprehensively. Although these threads are generally considered tougher and core CS content, they may complement degrees related to developing electronic systems/hardware. However, my suggestion is to undertake a double/triple minor using the overlapping course requirements among these threads. This is essentially the closest one can get to a "CS Double Major" without actually double majoring (because the requirements to double major are likely too significant for most practical purposes at Georgia Tech) as the double/triple minor comprises of 2/3 (reduced) threads similar to the major.   
5. **Theory**: This thread includes 1 "fundamental" course (Data Structures & Algorithms), but similar to the above 3-thread grouping, every requirement in this thread builds upon this mathematical/algorithmic side of CS (i.e. 2 more courses in algorithms are required). This thread also includes no elective/choice courses, with its core requirements typically being tough, high-level mathematical courses. As a result, this course may complement a quantitative, computationally high-level primary field of study.   
6. **Computational Data Analysis**/**Scientific & Engineering Computing**: These 2 threads, although varying requirements, are grouped together because they include courses (likely electives) that may overlap with one's primary degree, which is optimal to reduce the extra credit hours of the CS minor. They both also include no "fundamental" courses, but their requirements are heavily oriented on applied data analysis methods, which aren't emphasized in the 3 "fundamental courses" anyways. While this could be a useful minor for specific applications, generally I'd advise against it because many of the content/courses can be learned as an elective for one's primary degree, allowing one to learn new practical skills through taking a different CS minor.

To summarize, the Media thread covers all fundamental topics across the field of CS, making it the ideal option for a CS minor looking to learn the core knowledge of the degree. However, the ideal minor thread may vary if one's goals for the minor are to gain skills to enter software/application development (People & possibly Theory), computer/network systems engineering (Systems & Architecture, Information Internetworks, and Devices), CS research/mathematics (Theory), or data science/analytics (Intelligence, Computational Data Analysis, and Scientific & Engineering Computing). Also, the utility of elective courses (i.e. the aformentioned Biomedical AI instance), degree of difficulty of the primary major, and student interests will also impact the utility of each minor thread.
