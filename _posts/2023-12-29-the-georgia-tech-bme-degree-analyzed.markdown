In developing the (biomedical engineering degree visualizer project)[https://gt-bmed-degree-visualizer.onrender.com/], I researched the biomedical engineering degree-specific requirements at Georgia Tech. With this, here's my current understanding of the interdisciplinary curriculum by class subjects:

# Design

These courses seek to teach the principles of engineering (including critical skills/tools) in a project-based environment.
- BMED 1000: Intro to Design
- BMED 2250: Computational Design
- BMED 2310: CAD Design

# Math

This comprises a fairly standard set of requirements for engineering.
- MATH 1551: Differential Calculus
- MATH 1552: Integral Calculus
- MATH 1553: Linear Algebra
- MATH 2551: Multivariable Calculus
- MATH 2552: Differential Equations
- BMED 2400: Biostatistics

# Biology

The GT BME Curriculum includes no courses from the biology department, instead having a 2-course sequence/lab covering fundamentals of biology for engineering applications:
- BMED 3100: Systems (Macro) Physiology
- BMED 3110: Quantitative Engineering Physiology Lab 1 (Macrobiology Lab)
- BMED 3600: Cell/Molecular (Micro) Physiology
- BMED 3610: Quantitative Engineering Physiology Lab 2 (Microbiology Lab)

# Chemistry

The requirements for Chemistry go beyond most engineering degrees, but are less than Chemical & Materials Engineering.
- CHEM 1211K: General Chemistry
CHEM 1315: Survey of Organic Chemistry
- MSE 2001: Materials Science & Engineering Principles

# Physics

The requirements here are condensed from typical physics-heavy engineering degrees (i.e. mechanical & electrical). However, fundamental principles are covered.
- PHYS 2211: Mechanics
- COE 2001: Statics
- BMED 3410: Biomechanics (Dynamics & Deformable Bodies)
- PHYS 2212: Electromagnetism & Waves
- ECE 3710: Circuits & Electronics
- ECE 3741: Electronics & Instrumentation Lab
- BMED 2110 - Conservation Principles in BME
BMED 3310 - Biotransport (Fluid, Heat, & Mass Transfer)

Computer Science
CS 1301/1371 - Computing Principles
BMED 3520 - Biocomputing
